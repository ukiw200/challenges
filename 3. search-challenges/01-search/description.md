## 1. Introduction

Being able to effectively find and critically review information on the internet is an important skill for an IT professional. In the following challenge, you will be presented with a series of questions. Create a solution.txt and write down each answer on a separate line.

## 2. Challenge

1. Want to start learning to code but can't decide which language to learn? It might be a good idea to find out which is the most demanded programming language of this year. Do not base your answer on just a single source but find the most common top result. (1 word)
1. A common technique used by hackers is to insert malicious data into an entry field that is used for database query execution. How is this technique called? (2 words)
1. Windows and macOS are commercial operating systems. There is also a very popular open-source operating system that is free for everyone to use. This operation system has various distributions. In which year is the oldest distribution of this operating system released? (4 digits)
1. `StackOverflow.com` is a popular community platform for programmers to ask and answer technical questions. You probably will find it very helpful when you start learning to code. Find the answer on the following question on StackOverflow: how do I see in the Java programming language that two Strings are equal? Find the answer that is `accepted` as the best answer (a green checkmark) and has more than 6000 votes. (2 words, separated by a dot).
1. Find out what the size is of the largest solid state hard drive that you can buy today. Computers store data using electronic circuits that can distinguish between 2 voltage levels, which are represented as 0 and 1. This is called a `binary digit` or a `bit`. So information is stored as a series of 0's and 1's or `bits`. To represent a single character, you obviously need more than 1 bit. Find out how many times can we store a file with the word "Hello" on the largest solid state hard drive according to the UTF-8 encoding standard. (14 digits, no decimal separators)

## 3. General rules

In order to get a "SUCCESS" from the verify script, you will need to make sure that:

-   You have followed the instructions exactly as described in the text. Do not put extra text in files or create extra folders unless asked to do so.
-   Assume that the verify script is case-sensitive. Pay attention to the exact naming of files and folders.
-   Never make changes to the verify script (yes, we will verify all verify scripts afterwards). Changes to the verify script will result in a "FAIL" for the entire challenge.
-   You will only receive a "SUCCESS" if you complete all the steps successfully. If you only complete part of the challenge steps, you will receive a "FAIL" for the entire challenge.
