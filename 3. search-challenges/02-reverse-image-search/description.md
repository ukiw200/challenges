# Reverse image search

## 1. Introduction

Instead of using text-based search queries, you can also use images to find information. This is called "reverse image search". The technology behind reverse image search is based on **Content Based Image Retrieval (CBIR)**. CBIR is a technique that uses the visual content of an image (colour, texture, shape...). This is different from **text-based image retrieval (TBIR)**, which uses metadata such as keywords, tags or descriptions to find images. CBIR is also often used to find similar images to an image.

In the following challenges, you will see a series of images. Find a reverse image search engine on the internet and look for the information that is asked for. Sometimes you will need multiple search queries to find the answer. Create a solution.txt and write the answer of each question on a separate line.

## 3. General rules

In order to get a "SUCCESS" from the verify script, you will need to make sure that:

-   You have followed the instructions exactly as described in the text. Do not put extra text in files or create extra folders unless asked to do so.
-   Assume that the verify script is case-sensitive. Pay attention to the exact naming of files and folders.
-   Never make changes to the verify script (yes, we will verify all verify scripts afterwards). Changes to the verify script will result in a "FAIL" for the entire challenge.
-   You will only receive a "SUCCESS" if you complete all the steps successfully. If you only complete part of the challenge steps, you will receive a "FAIL" for the entire challenge.
