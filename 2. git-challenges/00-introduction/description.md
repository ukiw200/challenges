# Git Introduction

## 1. Prerequisites

All introduction challenges are completed.

## 2. What is git?

Git is a CLI or Command Line Tool. This means that it is a program without a graphical user interface. You use git by typing commands in a _shell_. Using a shell is a skill that you will learn and develop in the coming months, it might be scary at first, but it will get better!

In short, git is a tool for managing and tracking changes to files. Git provides a model and a set of commands to tackle the following problems:

- How does the complete history of a file look?
  - For every change to a file you can see:
    - Who made the change?
    - When was the change made?
    - What was changed?
- How can I go back to the previous state of a file?
- How can we work together on files?
  - What happens when we edit a file at the same time?
  - How can we sync changes across different computers?

Git does this by using _repositories_ and _commits_: 
- A repository is a directory in which git is active and is tracking all files
- A commit is a sort of save of certain files in the repository
    - How do all files added to the commit look at the moment?
    - What are the changes since the last commit?

On first glance, this might look a bit like Google Drive or Dropbox. But git is far more powerful than those tools and gives users far more control.

You can use git for all kinds of text-based files but we will mainly use it in the context of programming. When we work on a programming project we will always do so in a git repository and use git to track and share all files.

## 3. What is GitHub?

GitHub is a platform that allows you to store git repositories. This way there is a central place where everyone working on the repository can view its contents and sync their changes to.

## 4. Next steps

Do not worry if you do not understand everything from the movies immediately.

We will explore the concepts of both movies in the following challenges.
