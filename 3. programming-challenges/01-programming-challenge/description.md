# Programming Challenge

## 1. Introduction

This challenge will give you a first glimpse at programming. 

You will learn how to program vehicles to make them navigate a maze.

You can start the challenge by opening the file `tests.html` from the folder [challenge-files](./challenge-files/) in a web browser.

You can write your own code in the file `student.js`. After writing code you can refresh your browser to see the results.

### Introduction Week Workshop

If you attended the challenge workshop in the introduction week you have already started working on this challenge.

In that case, overwrite the file "student.js" in the challenge folder with the file from the workshop.

## 2. Challenge

Complete all levels up to and including "zigZag". All levels after "zigZag" are optional. 

To complete this challenge, commit the following:
* A screenshot from the file `tests.html` opened in the browser. Make sure that the green squares are visible in your screenshot so we can see how far you got. 
* The file `student.js` with all your written code

## 3. Extra

We encourage you to practice more and also try the later levels, but beware, they get quite difficult!
