# Forensics

## 1. Prerequisites

Once we have had an attack completed, the defense team should have an incident response to the security incident. Although, it's not a prerequisite to be able to solve this challenge ;-).


## 2. Introduction

This challenge is already a specialized (and expensive) form of incident response. Like investigating a murder case in CSI, the scene must be set in order to perform forensic analysis (in this case, dfir, short for digital forensics). Let's look at some basics regarding this process.

## 3. Challenge

Complete the following free room on "Try Hack Me": 
- https://tryhackme.com/room/introductoryroomdfirmodule

(Expert: For those of you who really want to get your hands dirty, you can complete this amazing room on Windows forensics: https://tryhackme.com/room/windowsforensics1)

Create a textfile solution.txt in the directory of this file. Answer the following questions (a new line for each answer, all in capitals):

1. Complete the timeline creation exercise in the attached static site in this room. What is the flag that you get after completion?

2. What forensics tool does remind us of a murder investigation?

3. If an incident occurred, it has been investigated and we have found the IP of the botnet server that was instructing bots to attack company ACME, what does this IP represent? We are looking for the abbreviation. Hint: answer can be found on https://attack.mitre.org/resources/sightings/ and has nothing to do with the Olympics.

Your textfile should contain 3 lines (all in capitals).

## 4. General rules

In order to get a "SUCCESS" from the verify script, you will need to make sure that:

-   You have followed the instructions exactly as described in the text. Do not put extra text in files or create extra folders unless asked to do so.
-   Assume that the verify script is case-sensitive. Pay attention to the exact naming of files and folders.
-   Never make changes to the verify script (yes, we will verify all verify scripts afterwards). Changes to the verify script will result in a "FAIL" for the entire challenge.
-   You will only receive a "SUCCESS" if you complete all the steps successfully. If you only complete part of the challenge steps, you will receive a "FAIL" for the entire challenge.
