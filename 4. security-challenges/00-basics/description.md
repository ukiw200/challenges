# Security Basics

## 1. Prerequisites

One of the platforms offering free and interactive security challenges is "Try Hack Me" (but others exist too, like Hack The Box). Create a free account on the www.tryhackme.com platform.

In some of the challenges you will learn some basic cyber security skills including ethical hacking. It is crucial to understand (and therefor necessary) that you need to follow a code of conduct and respect any laws and regulations applicable. If you are not sure if it is legal and without consequences --> DO NOT PROCEED! 

If you do stumble upon confidential information or a vunerability for an organization, read their "responsible disclosure" section and contact the organization immediately with your findings. For organizations in Belgium, you can read the following: https://ccb.belgium.be/nl/bekendmaking-van-kwetsbaarheden-aan-het-ccb

Your challenge will only succeed if you start the solution.txt file for this part with "I agree to the rules mentioned below"

Rules:

    Respect Privacy: Always respect individuals' privacy and personal data, ensuring they remain confidential and protected.

    Seek Permission: Obtain explicit permission before testing systems, networks, or applications, respecting the boundaries of authorized targets.

    Stay Within Scope: Limit activities to the scope defined by agreements or legal permissions, avoiding any unauthorized access.

    Report Vulnerabilities: Promptly disclose identified vulnerabilities to relevant stakeholders, supporting efforts to secure systems.

    Share Knowledge: Contribute to the cybersecurity community by sharing insights, discoveries, and methods to improve overall security.

    Do No Harm: Avoid causing damage, disruption, or loss while conducting security assessments.

    Continuous Learning: Commit to ongoing learning and professional development to stay current in evolving technologies and threats.

    Transparent Communication: Maintain clear and open communication with clients, collaborators, and affected parties.

    Lawful Behavior: Adhere to all laws and regulations governing cybersecurity activities, respecting ethical and legal boundaries.

    Accountability: Take responsibility for actions, continuously refining ethical practices to advance cybersecurity without compromising integrity."


## 2. Introduction

Thoughout these challenges we will introduce you to the field of cyber security. In order to understand the field of cyber security, you need to be familiar with some basic concepts. These concepts will be built upon or explored even more in other courses during your bachelor's program. Make sure you understand them well and success is in your hands!

## 3. Challenge

Complete the following free rooms on "Try Hack Me": 
- https://tryhackme.com/room/securityawarenessintro 
- https://tryhackme.com/room/principlesofsecurity

Create a textfile solution.txt in the directory of this file. Answer the following questions (a new line for each answer) and push your solution to your GitHub repository:

1. What website is useful to know about when checking if your account (and possibly the password for it) might have been leaked through a data breach? (format: xxx.com, so no "https" or "www" or whatsoever in front of the URL)

2. What famous hackers collective has been in the news many times already? Their logo has been used in many movies and tv shows too. (format: xxx)

3. What type of motivation is behind this collective? (format: xxx)

Your textfile should contain 4 lines (no capitals, all small characters).

## 4. General rules

In order to get a "SUCCESS" from the verify script, you will need to make sure that:

-   You have followed the instructions exactly as described in the text. Do not put extra text in files or create extra folders unless asked to do so.
-   Assume that the verify script is case-sensitive. Pay attention to the exact naming of files and folders.
-   Never make changes to the verify script (yes, we will verify all verify scripts afterwards). Changes to the verify script will result in a "FAIL" for the entire challenge.
-   You will only receive a "SUCCESS" if you complete all the steps successfully. If you only complete part of the challenge steps, you will receive a "FAIL" for the entire challenge.
