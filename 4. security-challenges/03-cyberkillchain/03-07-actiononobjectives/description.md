# Action on Objectives

A threat actor can either be an individual, but most likely it will be a group of hackers that have sophisticated skills and a lot of money (often referred to as an APT). A threat actor can have several motivations to perform a cyber attack. They might be interested in:

- the money (performed by criminal organizations), often by compromising systems or exfiltrating data and asking for a ransom 
- seeking the thrill and satisfaction (performed by thrill-seekers)
- espionage for geopolitical advantages, cyber warfare (performed by nation-states)
- making a statement for good purposes (performed by hacktivists) or for bad purposes like terrorism (performed by terrorist groups), often by performing a denial-of-service (DoS) attack
- making a statement for bad purposes form inside of the organization (performed by insiders)
