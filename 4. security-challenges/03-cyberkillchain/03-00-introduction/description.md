# The Cyber Kill Chain

![Alt text](images/SunTzu.jpg?raw=true "Sun Tzu - The Art of War")


This challenge is built upon the structure of a cyber attack (as described by Martin Lockheed in the Cyber Kill Chain paper). The Cyber Kill Chain paper can be found at https://www.lockheedmartin.com/content/dam/lockheed-martin/rms/documents/cyber/Gaining_the_Advantage_Cyber_Kill_Chain.pdf. However, there is a really cool video explaining it all very well - if you don't like to read: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II91fiUax2g 

Other frameworks about the attacking process have been defined and are very relevant if you ever want to work in cyber security (either as a pentester or as a defender). Please take a look at the following:
- MITRE ATT&CK Framework (https://attack.mitre.org/): A map of all tactics, techniques and procedures already used by some really advanced hacker groups (also called APT's = Advanced Persistent Threat). Explanation Video: https://youtu.be/GYyLnff2XRo 
- Unified Kill Chain (https://www.unifiedkillchain.com/assets/The-Unified-Kill-Chain.pdf): Combining the Cyber Kill Chain and MITRE ATT&CK framework since more and more attacks are not just one end-to-end process and one attack can involve multiple cyber kill chains in order to obtain the final objective.

For each challenge there will be one or more flag(s) to find. The flags (and format) will be specified.

Good luck in your attacking adventure!
