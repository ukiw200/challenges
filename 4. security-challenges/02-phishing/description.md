## 4. General rules

In order to get a "SUCCESS" from the verify script, you will need to make sure that:

-   You have followed the instructions exactly as described in the text. Do not put extra text in files or create extra folders unless asked to do so.
-   Assume that the verify script is case-sensitive. Pay attention to the exact naming of files and folders.
-   Never make changes to the verify script (yes, we will verify all verify scripts afterwards). Changes to the verify script will result in a "FAIL" for the entire challenge.
-   You will only receive a "SUCCESS" if you complete all the steps successfully. If you only complete part of the challenge steps, you will receive a "FAIL" for the entire challenge.
